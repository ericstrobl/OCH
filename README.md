# Optimum in Convex Hulls (OCH)

OCH is an algorithm for extrapolating from exclusive RCTs to the broader population by also leveraging observational data. The algorithm can extrapolate the conditinal average treatment effect and the conditional densities of treatment effect.

The ``Experiments`` folder contains code to replicate the experimental results for the synthetic data. The real STARD and TEOSS/CATIE datasets used in the paper require approval from the NIMH Data Archive (https://nda.nih.gov/). Please cite the article if you use any of the code in this repository.
